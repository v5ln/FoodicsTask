# FoodicsTask

This repository contains test projects focused on Google Search functionalities and the Foodics API. Various tools, namely Cypress and Selenium, are employed to achieve the test objectives.

While Cypress has been my primary tool for testing, this project was an opportunity to explore and learn Selenium. The experience was insightful, and to draw a comparison, I also crafted a version with Cypress for Google Search Testing.

## Structure:

1. **Google Search Testing**: This project aims at evaluating Google Search's core functions, especially focusing on the "More results" feature.
2. **Foodics API Testing**: This segment is dedicated to the Foodics API. Functions like logging in and user identification are tested thoroughly.
