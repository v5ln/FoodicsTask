# Google Task

This segment focuses on the Google Search functionalities. Emphasis is on the "More results" functionality, which is more prevalent in recent Google search designs, as opposed to the traditional "Next page" approach.

## Test Scenarios:

1. **Keyword Search**: Checks the relevancy of search results to the keyword.
2. **More Results**: Evaluates the "More results" feature to ensure it fetches additional results distinctively.
3. **Result Count**: Validates the result counter when search for a keyword
4. **Search Suggestions**: Verifies the uniqueness and relevance of suggestions as you type.
